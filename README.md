# Indian Agriculture Dataset

## Project Description
I have analyzed the Indian Agriculture dataset (made available by National Data and Analytics Platform, NITI Aayog) and then displayed the results as tables. One table shows the crop with maximum and minimum production in that year, and another table shows the average yield and cultivation area of the crop between 1950-2020.
